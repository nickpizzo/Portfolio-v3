  <p class="cbp-popup-article-heading">Project Tooling</p>
  <p class="cbp-popup-article-body">The React tooling ecosystem can be a complex place to navigate. Any critique of React includes the difficulty inherent in scaffolding a React project, as it requires the careful combination of a variety of robust tools. <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html">Resources</a> exist now to pretty much bypass this setup hurdle, but for this project I built a custom project environment with only the features that I found most crucial. It can be found on my Github <a href="https://github.com/nickpizzo/React-Environment-1">here</a>. This project uses separate webpack.config files for development and production. The development features include hot module replacement for automatic browser refresh upon saving changes, and built in sass preprocessing. For production, NPM scripts are used to uglify, minify, and copy files which are then deployed to Surge.sh.</p>

  <p class="cbp-popup-article-body">Rogue is a Las Vegas-based esports organization with teams in Overwatch, CS:GO, Call of Duty, H1Z1, and Vainglory. A page is maintained for each team where player and manager information can be viewed. Common to the industry is an extremely busy page-land experience. The team wanted a more minimal approach with plenty of character and theming consistent with its logo. </p>

  <p class="cbp-popup-article-body">React is specifically built for constructing user interfaces. A component based architecture is ideal for keeping front end code DRY and reusable. Across this site there were components that called for reuse. The player card below is the same component instantiated multiple times. Where details such as player name, player image, and player twitter account were different among each card, these values were passed as props to each component instance.</p>
