  <p class="cbp-popup-article-heading">Concept</p>
  <p class="cbp-popup-article-body">ZenSounds is a simple app that will drown out ambient noise and allow the user to concentrate on their work at hand, increasing productivity. It can also set the mood for a romantic evening or lull one to sleep, ensuring that sleep is sound all night long. ZenSounds is an ambient sound equalizer app for creating a mixture of ambient sounds on a mobile device.</p>

  <p class="cbp-popup-article-heading">App Flow &amp; Features</p>
  <p class="cbp-popup-article-body">The app prominently features the mixing board of sounds upon initial land, and returns the user here after any ancillary actions are taken within the app. The mixing board is considered to be the main interface where individual sounds are turned on and off in order to create a desirable mixture. Each sound has a unique icon that can be tapped to turn it on. Currently activated sounds appear in black, and currently silenced sounds appear in grey.</p>
